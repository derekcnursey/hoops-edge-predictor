## Guardrails

- Use the promoted shortlist as an internal late-season / March / conference-tournament aid, not as a public model output.
- NCAA tournament rows remain caution / diagnostic-only even if they clear the internal threshold.
- `flagged_mainly_by_disagreement = true` means the game would not have cleared the raw edge watchlist on its own.
- `raw edge only / filtered out` means the market-disagreement layer did not support the bet strongly enough.
